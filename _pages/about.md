Ahmad Bazzi was born in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. He received his PhD degree in electrical engineering from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), Sophia Antipolis, France, in 2017, and the MSc degree (summa cum laude) in wireless communication systems (SAR) from Centrale SupÃ©lec, in 2014. He is currently a Research Scientist at the [Wireless Research Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/wirelesslab/) of New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi, and NYU WIRELESS, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, contributing to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

He is an inventor with multiple patents involving intellectual property of [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) products, all of which have been implemented and sold to key clients. He is a Senior Member of the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and a full member of the [Sigma Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Xi), The Scientific Research Honor Society (Î£Îž).

Since 2018, he has been publishing lectures on the YouTube platform under his name "[Ahmad Bazzi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgC1d4JZ1Fz4t8MWLJD464w)", where his channel contains mathematical, algorithmic, and programming topics, with over 270,000 subscribers and more than 17 million views, as of November 2024. He was awarded a [CIFRE](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/les-cifre-46510) Scholarship from Association Nationale Recherche Technologies ([ANRT](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/)) France, in 2014, in collaboration with RivieraWaves (now CEVA-DSP). He was nominated for Best Student Paper Award at IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2016. He received the Silver Plate Creator Award from YouTube, in 2022, for his 100,000 subscriber milestone. He was awarded an exemplary reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Communications in 2022 and an exemplary reviewer for the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters in 2022. He served as technical program committee (TPC) member and a reviewer for many leading international conferences. He was selected amongst top 200 Top Arab creators for 2023. 
He serves as an editor of the IEEE Communications Letters, 2025.
His research interests include signal processing, wireless communications, artificial intelligence, statistics, and optimization.

# About me

I am currently a Research Scientist at the Machine Learning Research team at Apple, working with Josh Susskind, Walter Talbott and Devon Hjelm on fundamental problems of representation learning for sequential decision making tasks.

I recently defended my PhD at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and McGill University, co-supervised by [Devon Hjelm](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=68c5HfwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Doina Precup](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j54VcVEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, variational inference and representation learning.

I also was a research intern at DeepMind, working with Ankit Anand, Jake Bruce and Rob Fergus on unsupervised pre-training of state representations for efficient RL finetuning.

In the summer of 2021, I was interning in the Robotics team at Google Brain, with [Jonathan Tompson](https://jonathantompson.github.io/) and [Ofir Nachum](https://research.google/people/105364/), working on using self-supervised learning to improve generalization capabilities of offline RL agents.
I was a research intern at Microsoft Research, New York in the reinforcement learning team during summer 2020, working on counterfactual evaluation in contextual bandits. Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Montreal in the reinforcement learning team during summer 2019. I was also a research intern at Nuance during the summer of 2018 where I collaborated with [Atta Norouzian](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=KRPMXqYAAAAJ&hl=en). My work there focused on modeling acoustic signals such as speech with deep neural architectures.

I have completed my Master's in Statistics at McGill University under the supervision of [Johanna Neslehova](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). My thesis focused on reconstructing graphical models from discrete data with variational inference and multiarmed bandits. It can be found here: [link](https://bmazoure.github.io/files/thesis_Msc_2018.pdf). Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics in 2017 from McGill University.
