excerpt: 'In the evolving field of wireless technology, Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) presents a revolutionary paradigm by intertwining radar sensing with wireless communications for enhanced performance and resource efficiency. This study introduces two innovative approaches for estimating the angle of arrival and departure in bistatic ISAC systems. Our methods employ a deep learning framework utilizing complex neural networks and a specialized algorithm that both capitalize on a refined channel matrix. Notably, by integrating a preliminary coarse timing estimation phase, we successfully streamline the input data, boosting the system's computational efficiency. Our results highlight the deep learning method's efficiency, showcasing its ability to match the performance of a more traditional approach reliant on the MIMO model, yet with considerably less computational demand.'

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in wireless systems has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering the potential for improved performance, efficient resource utilization, and mutually beneficial interactions between radar sensing and wireless communications, thereby shaping the future of wireless technologies. In this work, we present two novel methods to address the joint angle of arrival and angle of departure estimation problem for bistatic ISAC systems. Our proposed methods consist of a deep learning (DL) solution leveraging complex neural networks, in addition to a parameterized algorithm. By exploiting the estimated channel matrix and incorporating a preprocessing step consisting of a coarse timing estimation, we are able to notably reduce the input size and improve the computational efficiency. In our findings, we emphasize the remarkable potential of our DL-based approach, which demonstrates comparable performance to the parameterized method that explicitly exploits the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model, while exhibiting significantly lower computational complexity.
