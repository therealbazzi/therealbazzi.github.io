**Abstract**: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a cornerstone technology for future 6G networks, enabling wireless environments that can support advanced communication and sensing. In this talk, we characterize SAC performance in by jointly optimizing the tradeoffs between sensing from a Bartlett perspective, and communication from outage SINR perspective. In particular, we formulate a framework that allows to achieve the aforementioned sensing and communication joint capabilities through beamforming. Our main results include the explicit dependencies of outage parameters on the SAC tradeoff. In particular, the correlation level between the steering vector towards the target and the channel between the dual functional radar-communication base station and the communication user directly impacts the ISAC trade-off.
