**Abstract**: Learn how to leverage the up-and-coming technology integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to maximize the potential of 6G technology. We'll explore how this will impact use cases across innovative applications from the automotive and unmanned aerial vehicle sector to robotics, and much more. I'll walk through simulations powered by NVIDIA GPUs that demonstrate the potential of this technology. We'll also explore the main challenges and current state of the art of ISAC for 6G.
